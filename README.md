# CardGameBackend
## Work rules
### Before starting work
* Create new branch
### While working
* Do whatever you like
### Before Commiting
* Update gitignore to remove all unnecesary data, like executables/hidden editor folders/editor data
* Check if you only commit source code and needed data(if something like that went to git add, update gitignore to skip those files in future)
* Please, don't just use some buttons to instantly push to update, I'm begging you, use also git status to check what files you'r commiting, before commiting
### After commiting
* push new branch to github, and open pull request for merging with update branch

## Meetings
* No strict rules. You need something, you ask something
